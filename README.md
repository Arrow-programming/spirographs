## About
The animation is the constant changing of the values of the spirograph function. A spirograph is a Roulette curve drawn with two gears and a pen (in the real world) and modeled with the epitrochoid Spirograph equation: 

>x(θ) = (R + r) * cos(θ) - d * cos((R + r)/(r) * θ)<br>
y(θ) = (R + r) * sin(θ) - d * sin((R + r)/(r) * θ)

Where: <br>
R = Radius One of the Stationary Circle<br>
r = Radius Two of the moving circle<br>
d = the distance from the center of the moving circle to the pen

Note that this program only models epitrochoids, and that any errors, deviations, or faulty rendering is a problem with your CPU and not the program.

Enjoy!
